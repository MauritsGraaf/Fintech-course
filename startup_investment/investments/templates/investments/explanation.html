        <h2>How It Works</h2>
        <p>Startup Investment Platform is a revolutionary platform that connects investors with promising startups, offering a unique opportunity to participate in their growth journey.</p>

        <ol>
            <li><strong>Investment Pooling:</strong> Your money is pooled together with other investors as a form of crowdfunding, allowing startups to access the funding they need to thrive.</li>
            <li><strong>Convertible Loan Agreement:</strong> Once a startup reaches its targeted funding, the pooled funds are converted into a convertible loan agreement, providing capital for the startup's operations and growth.</li>
            <li><strong>Email Confirmation:</strong> Upon completion of the funding round, investors receive a confirmation email along with the convertible loan agreement, formalizing their investment in the startup.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Why Convertible Loan Agreements?</h2>
        <p>Startup Investment Platform utilizes convertible loan agreements instead of shares for several reasons:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Flexibility:</strong> Convertible loan agreements offer greater flexibility in structuring investment terms, allowing startups and investors to negotiate terms that suit their needs.</li>
            <li><strong>Simple Execution:</strong> Unlike equity investments, convertible loan agreements require less administrative overhead and legal complexity, making the investment process more streamlined.</li>
            <li><strong>Early-Stage Financing:</strong> Startups at early stages may not have a clear valuation, making it challenging to issue shares. Convertible loans provide a financing solution without the need for immediate valuation.</li>
        </ul>
